## description

*w\_scan2* is a small channel scan tool which generates ATSC, DVB-C, DVB-S/S2 and DVB-T/T2 channels.conf files.

It's based on the old "scan" tool from linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.0. The differences are:
- no initial tuning data needed, because scanning without this data is exactly
  what a scan tool like this should do
- it detects automatically which DVB/ATSC card to use
- much more output formats, interfacing to other dtv software.

*w\_scan2* is a fork of the original *w\_scan* from https://www.gen2vdr.de/wirbel/w_scan/index2.html

#### main changes from **w\_scan** to **w\_scan2**

- keep duplicate transponders by default because a stronger transponder with
  the same ID might have a higher frequency and be discarded simply because
  it's scanned later. Also don't replace the current transponder with an
  advertised one by default. The latter may have a lower signal strength.
  More details here:
  https://stefantalpalaru.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/scan-all-the-things/ .
  The old behaviour can be enabled with -d (--delete-duplicate-transponders).

- re-enable VHF band III in Europe

## requirements

- up-to-date(!) DVB kernel headers with DVB API 5.3 support

## build

```sh
./configure
make
```

(developers making changes to "configure.ac" and "Makefile.am" also need to run `./autogen.sh`)

## distro support

#### Gentoo

```sh
layman -a stefantalpalaru
emerge w_scan2
```

#### Ubuntu

- Ubuntu [stable ppa](https://code.launchpad.net/~w-scan2/+archive/ubuntu/stable)
- Ubuntu [git ppa](https://code.launchpad.net/~w-scan2/+archive/ubuntu/git)

## basic usage

NOTE: Newer versions of *w\_scan2* need the '-c' option for specifying the
country (ATSC, DVB-C and DVB-T) or '-s' for satellite (DVB-S).


#### DVB-C (using Germany as country, option -c)

```sh
./w_scan2 -fc -c DE >> channels.conf
```

#### DVB-T

```sh
./w_scan2 -c DE >> channels.conf
```

#### DVB-C and DVB-T

```sh
./w_scan2 -c DE >> channels.conf && ./w_scan2 -fc -c DE >> channels.conf
```

#### ATSC (terrestrial, using United States as country)

```sh
./w_scan2 -fa -c US >> channels.conf
```

#### US Digital Cable (QAM Annex-B)

```sh
./w_scan2 -A2 -c US >> channels.conf
```

#### ATSC, both terrestrial and digital cable

```sh
./w_scan2 -A3 -c US >> channels.conf
```

#### DVB-S, here: Astra 19.2 east

```sh
./w_scan2 -fs -s S19E2
```

NOTE: see ```./w_scan2 -s?``` for list of satellites.

#### generate (dvb)scan initial-tuning-data

```sh
./w_scan2 -c DE -x > initial_tuning_data.txt
```

For more sophisticated scan options see ```./w_scan2 -h``` and ```./w_scan2 -H```.
