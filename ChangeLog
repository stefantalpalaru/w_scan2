ChangeLog:
--------------------
[1.0.14]
- include the PMT and teletext PIDs next to the video PID in the Mplayer
  output (Robert Bartel <r.bartel@gmx.net>)

[1.0.13] 2021-11-20
- add satellite data from fastsatfinder.com
- add --input-charset option

[1.0.12] 2021-03-29
- modulation strings for the dvbv5 output

[1.0.11] 2021-03-11
- work around iconv on FreeBSD not knowing about ISO-6397-2
- better XML tunning and channel data generation

[1.0.10] 2021-03-05
- generate initial tuning data output for dvbv5-scan
- updated "satellites.dat" file

[1.0.9] 2020-05-16
- support compilation with -fno-common (default in GCC 10)

[1.0.8] 2020-04-20
- Kaffeine output support was removed 6 years ago. Bring the docs up to speed.

[1.0.7] 2020-01-25
- fix "--output-initial"

[1.0.6] 2019-12-13
- re-enable VHF band III in Europe

[1.0.5] 2019-03-14
- added new arguments for isdb-tb tuners (tested with MyGica S2870 & PlayTV USB Hybrid PV-B308U)

[1.0.4] 2018-10-23
- replace country-based DVB-T skipping with new command line arguments:
  -ft1 and -ft2 to scan only DVB-T or DVB-T2, respectively

[1.0.3] 2018-10-13, contributed by DF5EQ
- DVB-T scanning is skipped for AT, DE and CO
- DVB_T2 scanning is no longer skipped at all, but a mechanism is in place for
  doing it by country
- PLP ID 1 is enabled for AT
- some manual code formatting in scan.c, where the line length limits of the
  formatting script rendered the code hard to read

[1.0.2] 2018-06-17
 - move the source files in a "src" subdirectory
 - apply some of the Linux kernel coding style indentation using the Lindent
   script from the kernel tree
 - merge w_scan-20170107

[1.0.1] 2017-03-29
 - fix a corner case where a pair of transponders kept adding each other to
   the scanning loop, without ending up in any list we use for avoiding them
   in the future. The end result was an endless loop. Thanks
   https://github.com/mfyorp for reporting the bug and testing the fix.

[1.0.0] 2016-10-14
 - project forked from http://wirbel.htpc-forum.de/w_scan/index2.html and renamed w_scan2
 - keep duplicate transponders by default because a stronger transponder with
   the same ID might have a higher frequency and be discarded simply because
   it's scanned later. Also don't replace the current transponder with an
   advertised one by default. The latter may have a lower signal strength.
   More details here:
   https://stefantalpalaru.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/scan-all-the-things/ .
   The old behaviour can be enabled with -d (--delete-duplicate-transponders).
 - all files are now ASCII or UTF-8 and have Unix line terminators
 - refactored the autotools files

2015-01-01
 - check data for descriptor 0x83 to be multiple of 4bytes;
   On S4E8 0x83 seems to be used for something different as LCN and
   caused segfault if read in 4byte packets.
   May be this abuse of 0x83 renders parsing of LCN unusable at all.
 - find_transponder_by_freq(): fix logging (add missing print_transponder() calls)
 - emulated dvb device;
   now accept DVB-S/S2 logs down to 20130331. However, logs earlier
   than 20140529 are missing last two bytes in SI data hexdumps. :(
 - modify scan algorithm for tsid, onid, nid;
   On S4E8, PAT transports wrong transport_stream_id - and therefore
   scan was endless loop. :(
   This was actually not an w_scan error, it is an error in sats si
   tables.
   1. find_transponder()
      - now do a strict check for (ONID,NID,TSID); check all 3 pids.
   2. check_duplicate_transponders()
      - copy NIT updated tp props from deleted tp to remaining tp,
        if remaining tp was not yet updated. Sync ids as well.
      - new function copy_duplicate_tp() to not have this copy several times.
   3. parse_pat()
      - update tsid for TERR scans only. On terr scans, freq may be '0' or
        completely wrong in NIT and find_transponder_by_freq() cannot find
        those transponders otherwise.
   4. parse_nit()
      - move update of (ONID,NID,TSID) to later position, where also tp props
        are updated. Code easier to read this way.
      - call check_duplicate_transponders() as soon as new tp was added from
        NIT.
   5. tune_to_transponder()
      - add missing polarization check for sat - this one is a bug fix.
 - vdr output: update translation table for satname: w_scan <-> VDR
 - scr_cmd: fix FE_DISEQC_SEND_MASTER_CMD data pointer.
 - update S4E8 transponder list

2014-11-22
 - move '-lrt' from LDFLAGS to AM_LDFLAGS
 - move nested function LeapYear() outside modified_julian_date_to_utc()
 - add stream_type 0x24 (HEVC)
 - bug fix: on Finnish DVBT/T2 network, 'other terrestrial frequencies' are
   signalled by other_frequency flag, but not transmitted in NIT.
   If those freqs could not be tuned due to bad reception, w_scan gets in
   an endless loop; fix it. Thanks to Olli Salonen for report and help
   debugging on remote side.

 - alloc_transponder(): check for polarization on sat.
 - update S19E2, based on emulated scan with logfiles
   from easy-vdr.de developers.
 - move freq calculations from Hz to MHz to separate func
 - if tuning fails on on any tp; instead of simply retrying with same
   settings -> redo with as much as possible params to AUTO. On some
   wrong NIT tables, params are just wrong, this *may* help in some cases.
 - start reworking VLC xspf playlist:
   * validate using http://validator.xspf.org/
     (NOTE: VLC-2.1.4 saved DVB xspf doesnt conform to XSPF)
   * compare to VLC-2.1.4
   * test VLC DVBT on Win64 using BDA

 - VLC xspf
   - remove unused stuff && started to adopt to current vlc;
     but no doc avail for this VLC file format. :(
 - Sat scan: add missing check of setup_switch() return value.

2014-01-02
 - add experimental(!) support for scr.
   i dont have spec && need testers for EN50494 for proper support.
2013-10-31

2012-11-11
 - apply patch from Michael Stilmant, who discovered two string buffers
   being too small by one byte.
2012-06-05
 - since some dvb drivers are buggy and dont tune DVB-S with ROLLOFF_AUTO,
   therefore now explictly set ROLLOFF_35 in case of DVB-S. Thanks to R.Warsow
   for report && testing.
   NOTE: this is just a work-around for broken DVB-S drivers,
         since DVB-S means by DVB standard *always* RO = 0.35
 - print transponder data from satellite list during scan to make debug reports easier
   to read

2012-05-25

 - VLC xspf output: as VLC-2.x.x no longer supports comma (VLC-1.x.x did) but only colon
   as separator, update xspf output format accordingly. Thanks to Jacek Sliwerski for
   report && samples.
 - increase max number of supported dvb adapters, based on a patch send by Julian Scheel.
    - auto scan: /dev/dvb/adapter(0..15)
    - by option -a <NUM>: /dev/dvb/adapter(0..31)
 - blacklist ( = look for a better device on auto scan ) Pinnacle PCTV 290e for cable:
    - known to have weakness on cable because of integrated preamp
    - it's driver doesnt report symbolrates correctly.
    - for terrestrial scan it's still a preferred device
 - no longer distribute a precompiled version of w_scan inside package.

2012-04-15
 - add a missing 'break' for initial tuning data on satellite,
   reported by L. Dolezel
 - rework audio language descriptor to avoid segfault,
   reported by L. Dolezel
 - add Israel DVB-T, requested by B. Nahari
 - update S13E0 transponders
 - fix bug introduced by 'transponder scan logic modified' in 20120128,
   which prevents -x option on US vsb/qam, reported by 'locuse'
 - add experimental cmake build support. For now building with autotools
   is still the standard way, but if you want to test, use
      cd w_scan-<VERSION>
      mkdir build && cd build
      cmake ..
      make
      make install
2012-01-28
 - modify dvb api < 5.5 logic, to find out which delsys are supported by hw
 - init-data: plot only verified data
 - transponder scan logic modified:
    - alloc_transponder(): add newly allocated transponder only to new_transponders,
      if freq not yet known.
    - tune_to_transponder(): add tuned transponder only to scanned_transponders,
      if freq not yet known.
    - find_transponder(): replaced by find_transponder_by_freq()
    - TODO: check side effects on 2nd gen delsys
2012-01-12
 - add hack to allow compile against api 5.3
2012-01-11
 - initial DVB-T2 support. Thanks for testing, code snippets and suggestions to Rolf Ahrenberg.
 - go back to allow to compile with DVB-API >= 5.3 and remove configure check (too early)
 - add video type to vdr output
 - change CAid to uppercase in vdr output
 - restructure Parameter print inside vdr output
 - add audio type and subtitling pids if vdr version > 1.7 (even if no '1.8.0' exists yet)
2012-01-08
 - fix a few compiler warnings, reported by rofa
 - fix configure script to check for DVB API >= 5.5 as reported by rofa
 - copy current transponder before parsing NIT in case of terrestrial
   since T2 delsys descriptor doesnt report all settings belonging to hardware.

2012-01-07
 - big cleanup:
    - no longer tune with dvb api 3.2 drivers (pls upgrade your drivers)
    - remove all occurencies of..
       - BANDWIDTH_*
       - FE_QPSK
       - FE_QAM
       - FE_OFDM
       - FE_ATSC
    - remove #ifdef's for features in dvb api added before 5.5;
      therefore: COMPILING NOW NEEDS DVB API 5.5 OR HIGHER !
    - because ofdm is no longer used by DVB-T only, Satellite frontends not
      only use QPSK, DVB-C2 will use OFDM similar to DVB-T(2):
       - rename ofdm_* to terr_*
       - rename qam_* to cable_*
       - rename qpsk_* to sat_*
       - rename tuning parameters
 - prepare on newer desciptors:
   - add T2_delivery_system_descriptor (untested - need testers)
   - add C2_delivery_system_descriptor (no linux support yet at all)
   - prepare on SH_delivery_system_descriptor (no functionality yet)
   - add network_change_notify_descriptor (no functionality yet)
 - prepare on DVB-T2 scan:
   - add bandwidths 10MHz, 1,712MHz
   - add FEC_3_5, FEC_4_5 (DVB-T2)
   - add QAM256 to terrestrial scan (DVB-T2)
   - add transmission modes 1k,16k,32k (DVB-T2)
   - add guard interval 1/128, 19/128, 19/256
 - add several new items to the internal transponder tuning data for later support of
   DVB-C2 and DVB-T2
 - now set plp_id during tune id terrestrial scan and delivery_system = SYS_DVBT2
 - try to discover supported delivery_systems per frontend using new ioctl DTV_ENUM_DELSYS
   if DVB driver has api version 5.5 or higher (fallback otherwise)
 - now do CRC32 checks in w_scan and prolong timeouts if CRC failures
   occur (may help in some cases if bad reception)
 - extend output format for 'scan' initial_tuning_data to deal with
   DVB-T2/DVB-C2.
   - old: # T <freq> <bw> <fec_hi> <fec_lo> <mod> <tm> <guard> <hi> [# comment]
          # C <freq> <sr> <fec> <mod> [# comment]

   - new: # T[2] [plp_id] [system_id] <freq> <bw> <fec_hi> <fec_lo> <mod> <tm> <guard> <hi> [# comment]
          # C[2] [plp_id] [data_slice_id] [system_id] <freq> <sr> <fec> <mod> [# comment]
   (NOTE: it's time to adopt 'scan' to API V5 && at least DVB-T2!)
 - update documentation in ./doc to reflect file change of initial_tuning_data


2011-10-11
 - add S152E0, S156E0, S166E0, update S160E0, thanks to ozvdr (Hans)
 - no longer skip over the following audio formats in case of VDR output (now supported by vdr)
   - 13818-7 audio w. ADTS transp syntax
   - 14496-3 audio w. LATM transp syntax
 - change xine output:
   old: output standard audio only.
   new: output AC3 audio. If not found, fall back to standard audio
 - change mplayer output:
   old: output '+' separated list of standard audio pids.
   new: output '+' separated list of ac3 audio pids, followed by standard audio pids.
 - change vlc xspf output:
   - apply stray newlines patch for vlc dvb-s format,
     as reported by Juergen Lock (cosmetics)
   - convert to UTF-8 using glibc
   - remove unneeded duplicated char recoding

2011-07-02
 - add requested format 'Gstreamer Plugin dvbsrc'
 - fix counting services
 - cosmetics

2011-06-16
 - updates to several satellites, thanks to Dotan Porat for
   reporting and providing initial patches
   - Nilesat 101/102 + Atlantik Bird 4A
   - one transponder on Astra 19E2
   - Amos 1/2/3

2011-05-02
 - fix wrong ATSC 8VSB and 16VSB identifiers for xine output, thanks to M.Krufky
 - now assume country = US, if frontend type = ATSC. This should work, since
   most non-US countries using ATSC still use the same channel lists as US.
 - now assume vdr format vdr-1.7, if VSB/QAM-B scan with vdr settings.
   ATSC users of VDR anyway need to patch their sources or upgrade to
   latest developer releases.
 - check if choosen frontend type fits to choosen scan type
 - extend -a option to allow string /dev/dvb/adapterN/frontendM
   you may now use -a (0..7) or -a /dev/dvb/adapter(0..7)/frontend(0..7)

2011-04-10
 - fix qam setting BR
 - add option -C <charset>, output coding (default: guess users codepage).
   if given, w_scan uses iconv to translate to this charset,
    i.e. 'w_scan -fc -cDE -C utf-8'
   if not given, w_scan tries to *guess* your charset and translates to that.
 - now guess users country if -c <country> not given.
 - add compiler flags: Wall, Wextra, Wno-comment, Wswitch-default, Wno-unused-parameter
 - remove all remaining <TAB> whitespaces.

2011-03-29
 - add Brasil ISDB-T/DVB-C, thanks to Mauro Carvalho Chehab
 - changed command line option '-S':
   - ordering of srates
   - add 6086
   - add 5217
   - remove 7000, because unreasonable
 - update man page accordingly
 - update S23E5 TP16

2011-03-13
 - update S41E9 and rename to S42E0

2011-03-06
 - NOTE@maintainers: it's called 'w_scan', not 'w-scan' or 'wscan'.<br>
   Please fix if mistyped in your repo.
 - fix memory leak in parse-dvbscan.c:142 (dvbscan_parse_tuningdata; char * buf)
 - fix memory leak in parse-dvbscan.c:489 (dvbscan_parse_rotor_positions; char * buf)
 - fix double deallocating pointer in scan.c:2999 (main; int frontend_fd)
 - fix memory leak in scan.c:2654 (main; char * country)
 - fix memory leak in scan.c:2722 (main; char * satellite)

 - check/report hardware frequency and symbolrate limits to avoid error
   messages in syslog
 - fix option -L (VLC output) in case of DVB-S. Thanks to Juergen Lock.

2011-02-06
 - bugfix: fix wrong comparison in check_frontend(), which lets the caller assume
   that to not yet have pll lock and wait until timeout is over. This may speed up
   each tuning to a new transponder a little. Thanks to Dick Streefland.
 - set PILOT_AUTO on satellite transponders found by NIT. There's no flag inside NIT
   to find explicitly 'ON' or 'OFF', so AUTO is the very best approach here.
   Thanks to Dick Streefland.
 - change <TAB> to <SPACE> in satellites.{c,h} and countries.{c.h} for better compat
   with wirbelscan-0.0.6.
 - add channel identifier USERLIST to channellist_t for compat with wirbelscan-0.0.6

2010-12-04
 - add experimental output format libvlc xspl playlist. Thanks to Zouhair Souissi for libVLC m3u patch,
   which was partially used for implementation.
 - update manpage
 - multiple AC3 pids
 - bug fix: missing string termination in parse_psip_vct (ATSC only)
 - cosmetics

2010-10-01
 - add: DVB-C symbol rates 6956, 6956.5 for New Zealand
 - mplayer output format as suggested by Pedro A. Aranda
 - cosmetics

2010-05-29
 - bugfix: if compiled with DVB-API-5.x, but using DVB-API-3.2 @ DVB-S,
   IF was not assigned before tuning. Thanks to Juergen Lock.
 - added some descriptor id's
 - update Astra 1E/1G/3A
 - changed help examples (wrong country id). Thanks to Tobias Grimm.

2010-03-16
 - update Hispasat 1C/1D S30W0
 - zero pids fix
 - add Telstar 5 S97W0
 - add ATSC channel syntax VDR-1.7.14
 - add DVB-C symbol rates 5156, 5483

2009-12-30
 - DVB-T UK: default to 8k transmission mode

2009-11-18
 - allow any 5.xx DVB API
 - removed some compiling warnings w. glibc-2.10.1/gcc-4.4.2
 - update transponders S28E2

2009-08-08
 - bugfix: increased buffer size for print_channel (scan.c:882; scan.c:1877) to avoid stack smashing,
   see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=513871 (reported by "Stephen" and Felix Kaechele)
 - changed struct tvct_channel to avoid gcc-4.4 warnings
 - is_nearly_same_frequency changed to allow 2MHz on sat; 500kHz otherwise
 - bugfix: is_different_transponder_deep_scan:304 auto = "ROLLOFF_AUTO"

2009-05-23
 - added S160E (requested by realkano)
 - using configure scripts now. If anybody can help improving configure script - you're welcome..

2009-01-01/2009-04-25
 - SYNTAX CHANGE:
   w_scan now needs (!) command switch -c for defining your country. use uppercase two letters
   for specifying your country, as defined by ISO 3166-1 use -c? for list:
		DE = Germany
		US = United States
		GB = United Kingdom
		FR = France
		...
 - restructured code
 - changed DVB-C frequency list
 - added freq list for Australia
 - improved freq lists for FR, GB, FI
 - added Option -e, extended scan flags, which allows to extend the scan to
    * additional scan QAM_128 (default: QAM_AUTO with fallback to QAM_64 + QAM_256)
    or
    * scan these additional symbolrates (default: 6900 and 6875 only)
        6111, 6250, 6790, 6811, 5900, 5000, 3450, 6950, 7000, 6952
   NOTE: expert settings, will slow down by a factor of up to 10.
 - reintroduced possibility to set manually
	- DVB-C modulation (new option -Q)
	- DVB-C coderate (new option -S)
	- DVB-C inversion (option -i)
	NOTE: these are experts settings only!
 - applied some code cleanups from Michael Krufky
 - applied 6MHz DVB-T scan patch for Taiwan (thanks to Michael Krufky)
 - added onid to kaffeine channels (suggested by Zend HetMij)
 - added support for parsing of dvbscan initial tuning data
		(new option -I)
 - started re-implementation of DVB-S (not yet finished)
		-> new options:
			-s (satellite setting, use -s? for list)
			-r (rotor position)
			-l (LNB setting)
			-D (DiSEqC switch)
 - w_scan now shares the list of satellites with wirbelscan plugin (0.0.5 pre1 or higher)
 - removed folder patches (obsolet)

2008-11-06
 - improved frontend detection (thanks to Hans Werner)
 - added a patch for single frequency scanning, see folder patches.
   This patch is not applied by default, if you need this feature,
   please apply patch and recompile. (thanks to Martin Dudok van Heel)
2008-08-15
 - added ATSC scanning support for terrestrial VSB & QAM Annex-B digital cable.
 (thanks to Michael Krufky)
 - removed vpid offset for H.264 channels
2008-07-20
 - added Copyright note, following the license of 'scan' from linuxtv-dvb-apps.
 - changed install location of {pci,usb}.{ids,classes} to /usr/share/w_scan
2007-12-09/2008-01-05
 - added H.264/AVC Video support
 - added ATSC A/53B Audio, ADTS Audio Stream, ISO/IEC 14496-3 Audio (not supp. up to now by vdr)
 (thanks to Steven Ellis)
 -additionally:
  -- support for ca-ids, no longer just setting ca-id=1 for encrypted channels
  -- support for language identifiers in vdr channels.conf
  -- no longer searching for 'other services' by default.
  -- added a lot of comments for information in moreverbose mode
  -- Makefile target dist added
2007-09-09
 - added kaffeine channels.dvb format, switch -k
2007-08-07
 - w_scan will no longer stop if frontend params cannot be set correctly.
   This is necessary, because newest mercurial dvb drivers seem to have sometimes
   difficulties with scanning complete frequency range. Additionally some cards added
   to pci.ids.
2006-09-03
 - added output format (dvb)scan initial-tuning-data
2006-09-01
 - applied w_scan-onid patch by Hartmut Birr which fixes that w_scan now
   records original_network ID instead of network ID
 - updated version of w_scan start script (which actually needs to be tested !)
2006-08-10
 - w_scan start script (first version)
2006-07-05:
 - removed QAM256 option "-Q", w_scan now uses either QAM_AUTO or (if not supported by hardware)
   it will do a two-step scan starting with QAM64 and QAM256
2006-02-16:
 - changed initialization for all cards, fix for airstar2 dvb-t and avermedia 771 dvb-t
 - xine output option -X
 - added dvb-c frequencies 113MHz, 121MHz and 858MHz, dvb-c freqs revised
 - dvb-c now scanning sr=6900 *and* sr=6875 both by default, therefore removed option -s
 - this version is tested with
	- fujitsu-siemens dvb-c ff
	- cinergy t2 usb2.0 dvb-t
	- airstar2 dvb-t
	- avertv avermedia 771 dvb-t
	(please report other working/non-working cards to me..)
